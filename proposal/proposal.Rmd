## 1. Introduction

In this project, we are analysing data from the LIGO detectors; specifically, we are looking at the waveforms corresponding to glitches in these detectors, classified into categories by a machine learning system trained on the responses of citizen scientists in the Gravity Spy project.

This dataset contains the metadata connected to each glitch, along with the glitch class that it was classified into; each glitch can be visualised on a spectrogram as a shape in the three-dimensional time-amplitude-frequency space, which is what the machine learning classifies it based on. The data includes four of these spectrograms for each glitch, identical except for what length of time they represent, in the format of the Gravity Spy project. The data therefore includes variables such as the peak and central frequencies, the bandwidths, phase, and the duration of these glitches, but also provides a few measures of the strength of the glitch: not only the simple amplitude value, but also the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each signal and the gravity spy ID number. Many columns were also provided which were entirely filled with one value, which I have decided to leave out of the descriptions, since they are of no consequence to the rest of the data. The URLs will also not be necessary, unless we want to look at the spectrograms for some reason (possibly as an example of a class, or a test of some classification schema). As an example, this is how Gravity Spy spectrograms appear:

<sub><sup> Unlike most Gravity Spy subjects, this is not a glitch, but a "chirp", either a real gravitational wave or one simulated by the LIGO staff. </sup></sub>

Here we will be analysing the different classes of glitches according to the different to attempt to see if we can find a combination of the other parameters (`bandwidth`, `peak` and `central` frequencies, `duration`, and `snr`) which can provide splits which approximate the machine learning's classification scheme. 

## 2. Data

Here, we load the data from the .csv file in the data folder into R as the `gravity_spy_metadata` dataframe, and remove several columns that have no use in any analysis of this data.

```{r load-GS-data}

setwd("/cloud/project/data")
gravity_spy_metadata <- read_csv("trainingset_v1d1_metadata.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  select(-c(8, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20)) %>%
  mutate(phase = param_one_value, .keep = "unused")
glimpse(gravity_spy_metadata)
```


## 3. Data analysis plan

Our predictor variables are `bandwidth`, `peak frequency`, `central frequency`, `duration`, and `snr`, while our outcome variable will be some approximation to the grouping system of `label` (an approximation, because we probably won't be able to replicate the categories exactly, only approximately).

### Data summary
To start our preliminary analysis of the data, we plot how common each of these glitches are compared to eachother in each interferometer:

```{r glitch-frequency}
customGlitchColour <- c("#ff0000", "#ff8800", "#ffff00","#88ff00", "#00ff00", "#00ffff", "#0088ff", "#0000ff", "#8800ff", "#ff00ff", "#ff0088", "#ffffff", "#aaaaaa", "#ff88bb", "#ffbb88", "#ffff88","#bbff88", "#88ffff", "#88bbff", "#8888ff", "#bb88ff", "#ff88ff")
gravity_spy_metadata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ifo, fill = label)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = customGlitchColour) +
    geom_bar(position = "stack") +
    labs(title = "Glitch frequency", subtitle = "in each of the LIGO interferometers", fill = "Glitch class", x = "interferometer")
```

First of all, we can see that several glitch classes are specific to each interferometer (although some may just have few enough examples that they don't show up in this graph). Another interesting thing to see is that Hanford generally has more glitches than Livingston, and that Blips, Koi Fish, and Low-Frequency Bursts appear to be the glitches with the most examples. To see whether this is accurate, we will now calculate summary statistics for each glitch class. The following summary statistics include the number of glitches of that class detected in each interferometer (columns `n_H1` and `n_L1`) and the means of each of the predictor variables for each class.

```{r glitch-class-stats}
glitch_class_summary <- gravity_spy_metadata %>%
  group_by(label) %>%
  summarise(snr=round(10*mean(snr))/10, peak_freq = round(mean(peak_frequency)), central_freq = round(mean(central_freq)), duration = round(100*mean(duration))/100, bandwidth = round(mean(bandwidth)))

gravity_spy_metadata %>%
  group_by(label) %>%
  count(ifo) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ifo, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(n_H1 = if_else(is.na(H1), 0, H1), n_L1 = if_else(is.na(L1), 0, L1), .keep = "unused") %>%
  inner_join(glitch_class_summary, by = "label") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  print(n=22)
```

In the next plot of our preliminary analysis, we plot out `bandwidth` by `duration`, with the colour of the points representing the label, to see how well we can group glitch classes by the general dimensions of the signal:

```{r bandwidth-duration-plot}
gravity_spy_metadata %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration, x = bandwidth, colour = label)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.2) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = customGlitchColour) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.1, "cm")) +
    labs(title = "Glitch classes by duration and bandwidth", colour = "Glitch class")
```

This image is a bit hard to read, since there are so many data points on the graph and they are nearly all in the lower section of the graph; still, one can see that in the lower part of the distribution the glitch population is dominated by the colours of Koi Fish and Low-Frequency Bursts, except for a stripe of blips (and assorted other glitches) at the very bottom.


### Methods

To find a good predictor of the glitch class, I think a good approach would be to start by finding a simple way to divide the space of all glitches into smaller groups of glitch classes, and then doing the same to these groups as well until we have groups that represent (fairly well) one glitch class each. To do this, a good strategy would be to start by plotting graphs of each variable against the others, and then looking for the simplest useful way to divide the data. 
However, this might not work well for some glitch classes, such as light modulation, which would be hard to create a single classification for, since they appear looking like a Blip followed by a Low-Frequency Burst, making them harder to classify well, in which case, it may be impossible to separate them from other glitches, since this dataset doesn't represent the data surrounding the glitches, only the data of the glitces themselves.
